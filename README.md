# trail_bot


##Background


##Description
trail_bot is a tool made for hikers of the Appalachian Trail. When a SMS message containing a trail-shelter is sent to ###-###-####, the bot responds with the current weather data and a three-day forecast for that shelter.



##Progress
This bot leverages Twilio, NodeJs, and MongoDB to bypass the end-users need for internet connection when retrieving weather data. 


##Work to be done
*Push to Heroku
*Add any missing shelters to database
*Hide OWID
