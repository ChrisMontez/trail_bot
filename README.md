# trail_bot

<<<<<<< HEAD

##Background


##Description
trail_bot is a tool made for hikers of the Appalachian Trail. When a SMS message containing a trail-shelter is sent to 256-598-9937, the bot responds with the current weather data and a three-day forecast for that shelter.



##Progress
This bot leverages Twilio, NodeJs, and MongoDB to bypass the end-users need for internet connection when retrieving weather data. Currently in pre-deployment. Local port tunneled by ngrok. If message is sent and a response is not recieved, that means I have the tunnel offline. App will be permanelty deployoyed to heroku after pre-deployment phase.


##Work to be done
*Push to Heroku
*Add any missing shelters to database
*Hide OWID
