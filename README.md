# trail_bot




trail_bot is a tool made for hikers of the Appalachian Trail. When a SMS message containing a trail-shelter is sent to ###-###-####, the bot responds with the current weather data and a three-day forecast for that shelter.



This bot leverages Twilio, NodeJs, and MongoDB to bypass the end-users need for internet connection when retrieving weather data.
